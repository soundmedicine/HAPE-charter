# HAPeChart

## Description

This application records and charts comparisons in growth between children born at high altitudes and those born at lower altitudes. This is a resource created in collaboration with Dr. Chris Ebert-Santos and Anicia Santos, to further research on High Altitude Pulmonary Edema.

## Problem Statement

1.  There is very little research done on the effects of life at high altitudes on child growth.

2.  Children showing normal symptoms that can be treated with simple, practical methods are often misdiagnosed due to lack of data comparing growth at high altitudes and average growth rates at low altitudes.

## Solution

1.  HAPeChart allows the current medical community to collect and integrate more data from high-altitude communities, while automatically updating charted growth rates with new data. It also offers a visual (charted) comparison between growth rates in children born and raised at high altitudes and children raised at lower altitudes. Provided with accurate data and an illustration of what an "average" growth rate and physiology (e.g. blood oxygen level), health practitioners will be able to more accurately assess patients.

## User Experience

1.  The application will open with a menu from which the user will be able to choose to

    * view several charts in a list, one illustrating average growth rates at sea-level, the others, growth rates at various high-altitude elevations,

    * select a chart or charts from a particular elevation (displayed in feet, available in meters) or location.

    * add new data for a particular case, including blood oxygen levels, height, weight, etc. to be added to the charted data, via a form page,

    OR

    * view a single growth record, superimposed on charts illustrating average growth rates at various elevations that can be selected from a drop-down menu.

2.  Each page will feature a menu to access the other pages.

## Technology

1.  The front-end will be built using HTML, Materialize, C#, Chart.js and Google Maps.

2.  The back-end will be built using Knex, PostgreSQL, Node.js, and Express.
